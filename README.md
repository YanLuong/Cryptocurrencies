# Cryptocurrencies

In this Cryptocurrency project, I will use unsupervised machine learning to group cryptocurrencies and decide on a clustering algorithm. 

* The data will be preprocessed to fit the machine learning models by reducing dimensions.

* Finally, the results will be visualised in scatter plots.
